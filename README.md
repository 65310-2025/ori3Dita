### Setup

Create a mongoDB account and generate your SRV (database connection string). Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and populate all the fields with your own values. For `SESSION_SECRET`, you can put any random string, preferably a long one generated by `uuidgen` or similar.

Additionally, copy `client/.env.template` to `client/.env`. This file needs a Google auth client ID, which can be created [here](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients).

Then, run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

### Running the app locally

To run the app in dev mode, run `npm start` in one terminal to run the backend, and run `npm run dev` in another terminal to run the frontend. Both these commands will automatically re-run if you change a file, so it live updates. Make sure your frontend is on localhost:5173 (if it's not, you might have issues with google auth - this could happen if your port 5173 is being used by somthing else), and go to localhost:5173 to check out the site!

### Running the app in prod

To run the app in prod, simply run `npm run prod`, which will build the app and then run it on localhost:5173. Alternatively, run `npm run build` and then `npm start`. However, note that this method defaults to running the app on localhost:3000 instead.
